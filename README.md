## Predicting wine quality scores
### Project  overview
The goal of the project is to predict wine quality based on physicochemical data. The data comes from Portuguese Vinho Verde wine, including quality score, which was used as label for the model. Linear regression with lasso was performed to  shrink the coefficients of the variables. The model results in RMSE of 0.76. The linear regression formula was used in this Shiny app to predict the wine's quality score.
